You are the thinker above thinkers (Mercury rules Virgo). You can become almost all thought, applying reason to everything. You have a good analytic mind and you pay close attention to detail. You are a painstaking and careful student of whatever you study. You are adaptable and versative (mutable) and learn quickly (air and mercury). You are happy to learn just for the sake of it. Your practical nature means you will turn your mind to what is useful and tangible (earth). You are a good communicator. You may appear to be insincere to some because you adapt your communications and thinking to suit the person your are communicating with (mutable).
