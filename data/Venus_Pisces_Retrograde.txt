With Venus in Pisces and retrograde, there may be a strong tendency to romanticize the past, to keep their affections private, or an attraction to secret relationships. There may also be awkwardness with outward expressions of compassion, even though the native is a compassionate soul. These people may need to really work on feeling deserving of a partner who openly acknowledges the relationship, or of a relationship that doesnâ€™t involve excessive sacrifice or imbalance.
