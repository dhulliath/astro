Traditional astrology interprets Saturn’s presence in the second house to mean a lack of or difficulty in getting real world possessions like money, cars, etc. Moving away from this fatalistic approach, we will try to personalize the meaning of Saturn in the second house for an individual. From a personality standpoint, the second house reflects your attitude to real world possessions. With Saturn in the second house, you might be unduly pessimistic about your own ability to get possessions. Avoid the pessimism. Then again, you might be overly cautious in the way you invest your finances. I’ll give you an example to illustrate this point. Saturn in the second house people are more likely to invest their hard earned money in low-risk treasury bonds than in the higher risk stock market. This may be good or bad, depending on how you look at it. Your investments will remain rock solid over the years, but will not grow as much if you had been more of a risk-taker! Given this risk aversion, isn’t it easy to spot why past astrologers might have taken that as an inability to gain wealth or possession? It’s not so much an inability as simply an attitude. Awareness of this attitude can be your strength.
