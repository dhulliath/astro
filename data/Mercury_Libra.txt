You are a diplomatic and balanced thinker and communicator. Your mind tends to be directed to interpersonal relationships (interpersonal), and groups, so you may not be interested in studying science or engineering. You are a thinker who is careful about what they say (air, balance). You are likely to be good at initiating communications (cardinal). What you say and think comes from you, rather than to do things for because of others (active).
