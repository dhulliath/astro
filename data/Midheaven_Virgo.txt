You like to have a stable routine in work, and be immersed in detailed fine tuning kinds of activities. An analyzing mind makes you a thorough researcher, writer, teacher, librarian, public servant or data collector. You don't mind specializing, and might be drawn into particular fields of science or medicine. Those with earthy charts channel that love of a daily rhythm into farming, healing, alternative medicine. You make your mark as someone that works hard and has high integrity, along with a sense of duty and service. Your work may involve healing the Earth, purifying the body of dis-ease, teaching others about the inter-dependence of systems. You could find fulfillment in holistic health fields, literature, creating healing environments like spas, health food stores or yoga centers.
