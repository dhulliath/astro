Like a heavy rock, you are hard to move, but once to start moving you are hard to stop (fixed). You tend to stick with what you have, being reluctant to change. You tend to accumulate wealth, etc (possessive), because having material things is important to you. In your life, you tend to be practical (earth). Your thinking is usually down-to-earth (earth). You are a good listener and are slow to react. You may have a tendency to act because of others, rather than to be be self-caused (passive).
<br/><br/>What is important to you is what is desirable and valuable. You value security and avoid change.
<br/><br/>An archetype of Taurus is the farmer or burgher, conservative and cautious about change.
