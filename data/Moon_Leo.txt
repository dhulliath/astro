This is a rather creative position of the Moon. At the very least, Moon in Leo people want to create and entertain. They can be rather lazy at times, and a little bossy too. Generally, though, they have a deep need to treat others fairly and justly.

Lunar Leos require lots and lots of love and care in order to function well in the world. When they feel slighted, these people can be dramatic in their emotional displays. When their pride has been hurt, they are given to big scenes and sulking. This rarely happens in public, however. Lunar Leos are far too concerned about their image to make splashy scenes outside the comfort of their own homes. In public, they prefer to take things in dignified ways. At home, however, they’re given to big displays of emotional drama. These scenes generally don’t last too long, however. Lunar Leos are often personally popular folk who are valued for their integrity and strong sense of justice.

Moon in Leo folk are very proud, and they are rarely happy to follow orders. Leo is a Fixed sign, and it can be difficult to change a Lunar Lion’s mind or to change up plans on them at the last moment. They need time to adjust to schedule changes.

Generally, it is easy to reason with a Lunar Lion. Appealing to their well-developed sense of fairness usually works well.
