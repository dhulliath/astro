You value freedom and tolerance more than anything else. You follow your own way (active), but you can change to suit others (adaptable). When necessary, you can be forceful, and speak your mind (fire). You have a dual nature (centaur), being in touch with your animal nature as well as your far seeing human nature (I seek).<br/>
<br/>
You can expand beyond the physical, the day-to-day world to higher levels of knowledge. While Gemini seeks to know things, you seek to know at a deeper level. While Gemini seeks facts, you seek principle and generalisations.<br/>
<br/>
What is important to you is freedom (for all) and being tolerant of others.<br/>
