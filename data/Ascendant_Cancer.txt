Cancer Rising is a gentle soul. They feel like someone you have known a long time… they are familiar.They are sensitive to their surroundings, and get flustered easily, especially in crowds. When they feel threatened, their first instinct is to protect themselves. They are usually shy in new situations or when meeting new people. They will approach these situations with caution, and gradually allow themselves to warm up to the situation as they get a bit more comfortable. They are caring and sweet. On the opposite side, when a Cancer Ascendant has retreated so deeply into him or herself, they can be anything but sweet or approachable. They can appear moody, insecure or overly sensitive.
