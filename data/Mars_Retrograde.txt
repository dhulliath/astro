Standing up for yourself or asserting yourself may be a challenge, as it can stimulate fears of being ineffective when Mars is retrograde at birth. There might often be roundabout ways of going after your desires. The desire nature runs deep, but is often misunderstood by others. Timing might often be off, or you could express your desires (or anger) in bursts rather than more flowingly, whereby you keep these things to yourself and let them build until you explode. You may come on too strong some of the time, and not enough at other times, often thinking of the better thing to say or do only later, when youâ€™re no longer under pressure. Competition can unnerve you, and you are usually better off setting your own pace than working by schedule or with others. You might come up with very creative ways of expressing yourself physically as you mature, or channel your energy into unusual but effective areas quite effectively.
