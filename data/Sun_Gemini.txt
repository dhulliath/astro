You are a thinker (air) rather than a doer. You are able to turn your hand to new things easily (versatile). You are a good communicator, but might tend to jump from one subject to another (variable, mutable). You can, however, be logical (air) rather than emotional. You may tend to make many short journeys, going here and there in the locality. Or you may be restless and itching to do something. You may be witty and  a good speaker, (air). You may be a different person for different people, changing your communication to fit the other person (Twins).<br/>
<br/>
What is important to you is to communicate and to be informed through the six senses. You value reasoning and words, rather than feelings.<br/>
