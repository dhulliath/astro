You take pride in what you own, and you have a strong drive for security. You have staying power, and you hate to let others down once youâ€™ve made a promise. Avoid over-identifying with what you have. Concentrate on proving your worth through your strong value system and your incredible ability to stick with things and with people. Take pride in the solid and secure foundations that you build, as well as the lasting relationships you aim to maintain while being careful to avoid possessiveness.
