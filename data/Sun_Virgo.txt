You are a detail person, and consider things part by part, (analytical and critical), but you can learn integrate them into a new whole. In this way, you can be a great scholar. Being critical can help you as a scholar, and you can mature so you avoid being a nit pickers, criticising others for small errors. You are motivated by others and do things for others, rather than for yourself (passive). That is, you are pleased when you help others. But you are no doormat. You are extremely good at following procedures, and you may be a perfectionist. You are a practical person (earth) and you are versatile, being able to turn your hand to different things. You are work oriented, and may make work your whole life, perhaps talking and thinking about work all the time. You don't mind changing from one thing to another, especially if another wants you to (mutable).
<br/><br/>What is important to you is the details. And, to you, perfection is the absence of faults or wrong details. You cannot resist picking the hair off someone's coat! Work is important to you and you see yourself in terms of your work.
