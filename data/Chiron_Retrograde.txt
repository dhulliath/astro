Natal Chiron retrograde indicates that this is a time to discover previously unrecognized abilities. Often, the most beaten down parts of ourselves are actually our greatest strengths. However, they've never been developed or cultivated and remain in that wounded, beaten down state. This lack of growth somewhere in our lives is now holding us back. It's time to let these wounds heal, to let go of old grudges, to wake up to how powerful we can be if we cease being a "victim".
