You shine in fields where you're able to swim in deep waters. A very creative Mid-heaven, that sets you up to be an artist, performer, a healer, a friend to kids and animals, and use your intuition as a tool. Your strength is your sensitivity, but also may keep you from claiming your full potential. Your gift is to shape the collective messages, through song, story, nurturing, spiritual teachings, and just by being who you are.

You may be drawn to working on or near the water, and have the ability to tune into non-verbal kinds of communication (animals, marine life, nature spirits, elementals, inter-dimensional beings). Pisces rules the feet, and this could lead to work as a reflexologist, podiatrist or just someone that loves to give/receive foot massages!
