With Venus in Cancer and retrograde, the love nature can be very introspective and loving, although many people might not know how much these people care until they truly get to know them. This is a very emotional, sensitive position. Rejection, difficult break-ups, and dissonance in love can stick with these people for years. It can be challenging to get over hurts. If insecure about what they have to offer, they can be so maternal in their demonstrations of love and affection that they run the risk of smothering a partner.
