You bring great energy and enthusiasm, and have a sense of urgency about organising your life. You are a powerful starter of things (cardinal), but might not be so good at seeing them through to their conclusion. You are however enterprising and never short of ideas (cardinal). You tend to be self centred (I am) and to forcefully or enthusiastically (fire) seek your goals, without taking into account how others might react. You are keen start things right away, but you may give up if you do not attain your goals quickly.<br/>
