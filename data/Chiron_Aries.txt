You need to bring about the fullest potential, in an energetic and urgent way, in matters concerning the presentation of yourself. It could be that, for instance, you lack self-confidence, or you are too self-confident, for example. The solution lies within the problem (Perhaps in Libra, in relation to others). It is the other side to the problem. One route to solving the problem is to take action and do something about it (fire). You may be a great teacher, who is better at helping others, than you are in helping yourself.
