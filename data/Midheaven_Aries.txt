You surge toward new careers many times in life, with some false starts abandoned. This gives you an edge in the current atmosphere (with the need to change careers), and a willingness to forge ahead in new areas. A need to be boss opens the door for self-employment. You are the dynamic leader, whether on stage, in the military, in sports, business, law, politics. A naturally competitive (and combative) public persona brings you success in a fighting role in whatever field you choose. You're not afraid to take daring risks, and that sets you apart. You like to be a trailblazer, and can be a model in these times for great leaps into the evolutionary future.
