Strong emphasis can be placed on the sensual side of love, or the security of it, with Venus in Taurus retrograde. These people should avoid spending too much money on their lovers and consider that they are enough. Of course, this puts them in a vulnerable position, as many retrograde Venus people fear that they are not enough. They may be considered selfish or self-centered. Although they can be very sensual and present, there may be a level of intimacy lacking if they are insecure.
