It can be a little difficult to understand exactly what makes a Mars in Aquarius native tick. And that’s absolutely fine with themthey enjoy surprising people. The tried-and-true methods of getting things done are far too boring for those born with Mars in this unique and original sign. Mars in Aquarius natives often have a rather original view of the world as well.

These natives are generally quite proud of their independence. They are not easily pushed around with Mars in this fixed sign. Because Aquarius is progressive and open-minded when it comes to the world at large, it can be surprising that on a personal level, Mars in Aquarius natives can be quite obstinate. If they feel boxed in, they are quite likely to rebel. If you’ve discovered a pattern to their ways, they’ll make sure they aren’t so predictable the next time around. Being seen as “normal” simply won’t do!

With Mars, the planet of energy and drive, in an Air sign, these individuals get off on mental and intellectual pursuits. Aquarius is a somewhat scattered sign, even though it’s persevering in the long haul. If there’s a method to their madness, it isn’t always easy to see. Projects are taken on with a shotgun-style approach with this position of Mars.

Mars in Air signs are generally quite clever at getting what they want; in Aquarius, they are particularly adept at getting their way. While this is not an overtly aggressive position of Mars (Aquarius has a manner that is far too detached to come across too forcefully), it is very willful. Combine willfulness with the cleverness of an Air sign, and you have a person who is quite creative about getting what they want–which generally is getting their way! Unlike with Mars in Aries or Leo natives, for example, you won’t always know you’re being dominated by a Mars in Aquarius native!

One of the most pleasant characteristics of Mars in Aquarius natives is their willingness to let others be. They place a lot of value in freedom and individualitytheirs and yours. They need space to be themselves and plenty of room to breathe. Generally not the touchy-feely types, these natives often laugh at sentimentality and tradition. In personal relationships, their approach to intimacy is definitely on the detached side, which can be baffling and frustrating to more personal and affectionate personalities.

Of all the personal planets in the sign of Aquarius, Mars placed here can show the strongest “reformer” streak. The Aquarian ideal of equality works big time with this position, and the desire to push their agenda on others (usually in creative, rather than aggressive, ways) runs high. Obstinacy and a superiority complex are this position’s least desirable traits; openness to new ways of doing things (as long as they’re not forced upon them) is where they shine.
