The fifth house is the house of play and self-expression. Saturn’s influences in this house compare in importance to those in the first house. The fifth house is all about spontaneity. Saturn seriously impedes spontaneity. You might be recognized as the “party pooper” or a bad date. Don’t let that happen to you! Individuals with Saturn in the fifth house might find it difficult to “play” or do fun things. Saturnine guilt and responsibility might make you search for a “good” reason to have fun. All work and no play might stress you out to the point of neurosis. Recognize that you don’t always need a cause to relax and enjoy life. Better still use this influence to your advantage. Get into an activity like raising money for a charity. That way you have a cause and the fund-raising events can be turned into fun occasions. While dating, allow your date lead you a little. If your date happens to have a fifth house Saturn then you have nothing to worry about. The two of you may hit it off discussing the ramifications of the ozone layer depletion on your first date. If your date does not have Saturn in the fifth then he or she might have other ideas about ways to have a good time!
