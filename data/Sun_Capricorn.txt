You are wise when it comes to handling your affairs (prudent), and you are careful about what you say or do (reserved). You are a practical person at heart and believe in what you can touch and feel (earth). You are good at starting things (cardinal sign and fire), but unlike Aries, you can put the breaks on and avoid being impulsive. You can wait for the right time (Saturn ruler). You may be good in business. You are quietly persistent because of your practical outlook. You are more likely to do things for the sake of something else, or for others (passive). Like the mountain goat, you are (metaphorically) careful where you put your feet and you can take the rough with the smooth.<br/>
