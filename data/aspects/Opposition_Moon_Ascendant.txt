 Intuitive, sympathetic, and sensitive, quick to sense the needs and emotions of others around you. However, the tendency to over-identify with the feelings of others can be draining, and you can lose touch with where your feelings start and end. Getting in touch with what it is that you need will be the main challenge, but a necessary one, as you can too easily confuse others and yourself, and dependency may be a problem in your life if you don’t. Your manner is expressive and emotionally animated–you come across as either emotional or caring/nurturing (or both), and generally likable.
