Those with Moon in conjunction with the Ascendant in their natal charts are quite impressionable and their moods change often. This is not to say that they are weak characters–they most certainly can be strong individuals. However, they pick up tremendous amounts of impressions from their environment and are sensitive to the slightest of temperature changes (not only with regards to the weather, but feeling/spiritual sensations from people and the surroundings as well).

They can easily project confusing signals to others. On one hand, their attachment to the home and family, as well as the projection of a somewhat dependent or needy personality, gives off the impression that they are seeking warm attachments with others.
