<p>You take pride in your ability to negotiate and to establish harmony in your relationships. It is important to you to have a partner, as you feel incomplete without one. You are motivated to become well-liked, and you are especially sensitive to rejection.

Use your social skills and seek out peaceful relations with others, but try not to over-identify with your partnerships and the way you are received by others.</p>
