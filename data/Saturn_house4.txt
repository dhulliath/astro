The fourth house indicates the way you relate to your family, both as a child and adult. It indicates your attitude to giving and receiving “mothering” or nurturing. Saturn in the fourth house can limit the nurturing that you yourself are capable of. Your style of nurturing may come across as slightly cold and impersonal. You might remember your childhood as one that lacked warmth and affection. Saturn’s influence adds a sense of responsibility to fourth house functions. One might feel the need to nurture more than most, perhaps to overcompensate for their own feelings of being neglected. The truth is mothering and nurturing can be fun! Saturn might take away that element of fun and make it a chore. Don’t let that happen to you. Recognize your style and make up your mind to enjoy yourself! In a broader sense, the fourth house extends to the community, home town, and country. With Saturn influences, you will choose to be quietly patriotic and loyal.
