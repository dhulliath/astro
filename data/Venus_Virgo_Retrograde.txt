With Venus in Virgo and retrograde, there can be some timidity when it comes to sharing their hearts. They tend to show their love through helping, being of service, and tending to the practical side of a loverâ€™s life. Women with this position may have a hard time believing in their own lovability and attractiveness; men with this position may have unusual attractions or fixations that could stem from a fear of closeness.  They can be slow to develop serious relationships, and can have a very difficult time moving on emotionally after a relationship comes to an end. They have strong feelings about relationships and assigned roles, tending to reject the traditional, and many are feminists.
