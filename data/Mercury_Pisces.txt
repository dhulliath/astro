You may have a gift for inspirational writing, particularly poetry, and a love of this kind of literature. You may be inspired by ideas or hunches that enable you to express yourself artistically (passive, water). You are adaptable and versatile in your thinking so you can adjust to new ideas (mutable), especially those which relate to deep religious or even mystic ideas (deep water). When you communicate ideas, you may not know where they came from and you may be skilled in mediumship.
