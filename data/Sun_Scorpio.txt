<p>
<p>You are deep and intense (intense and secretive) and hide your intentions or you are unaware of them, however, you enjoy digging into the depths of other people and finding their secrets or hidden motives. You may be driven (passive) by deep, hidden emotions (secretive, water). You may be slow to get started on things (stable), but once started you can become a powerful torrent, which is difficult for others, and for you to stop (fixed). You are more likely to be driven (passive) by deep emotions (water) than to follow your true self.</p>
<p>What is important to you is digging beneath the surface and finding the hidden truth. You do not take things at face value. However, you keep your own personal feeling secret from others.</p>
<p>An archetype of the detective, seeking the truth which is hidden, perhaps by lies.</p>
