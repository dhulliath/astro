May indicate, perhaps unintentional, criticism by parents or siblings about the way you expressed yourself, producing a lack of self- confidence. There may have been some injury to your voice or you may have been too shy to speak. Your thoughts and words may take time to be expressed so as to be correct. Any errors you make will be excused so as not to appear to be in the wrong. Do not let yourself be hampered by technicalities, and learn to admit to mistakes.
