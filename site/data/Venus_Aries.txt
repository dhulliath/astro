Pleasing Venus in Aries involves fueling their need for action. Be direct, open, and honest with them — they won’t much like game-playing or evasiveness, unless it is in the complete spirit of fun. Feed their need for spontaneity, and appreciate their playfulness. Understand their desire for the relationship to remain young and fresh.

Indulge them their many whims, and understand that they thrive on competition, even when they’re competing with you!
