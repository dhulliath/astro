The sun (to integrate, to make important)) in Aquarius (Indifferent and Unconventional)<br/>
<br/>
You may appear to be aloof and you have a basic urge to be different. You are a thinker (air) and you are very persistent in what you do (fixed). You follow your own path and do what you want to do (active). You may be inventive or unconventional. However, you do not change easily (fixed). You are sure and confident about what you believe. (I know). You are concerned not so much about yourself, or your family, as you are concerned about the world, and may value your friends more than anything else.
