The ninth house signifies ideas, philosophies, and rationalizations of the conscious mind. It opposes the third house which governs the unconscious mind. The ninth house, therefore, governs the functioning of the higher mind — those thought processes that define us as humans. Mind expansion is a basic ninth house function. The ninth house signifies an individual’s personal philosophy of life, perception of the reality of life, and reaction to new ideas. Saturn in the ninth house indicates a practically minded individual. You are unlikely to take to flights of fantasy or fancy ideas. You might even be closed to new ideas. Your thinking might be overly closed and conservative. Don’t close your mind! Be aware that while practicality is a great quality, the world needs people to come up with new ideas in order to move forward or even keep going. Don’t dismiss ideas too quickly and don’t be threatened by them. Instead, adopt a constructive attitude. Tell yourself and others that you can be practical in your thinking. And, that is an asset. At the same time, encourage people around you to think and act out their ideas and philosophies. You can be close-minded and mean, or the sane anchor of practicality for the creativity around you. The choice is yours!
