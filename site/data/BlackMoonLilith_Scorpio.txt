Lilith doesn’t have an official ruling sign, but many astrologer suggest Scorpio as her ruler, given the sign’s association with sex, death, and other taboos. Lilith does feel at home here, with amplified powers of seduction, business acumen, and psychic connection. What more can you ask for, really? The only caution here is: use your powers wisely. Don’t strike out unnecessarily, because karma may be less than kind.
