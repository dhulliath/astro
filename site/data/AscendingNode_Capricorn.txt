The South Node in Cancer indicates an intense desire to care for people. However, overconcern with other people’s emotional well-being may be a sign of your fear of taking charge of your own destiny. This overconcern shows itself as dwelling on the past, being afraid to come out of your shell, making other people’s feelings your problem. You are here to rediscover the thrill of achieving your goals. You need to let other people work out their own problems, and develop and cultivate your own ambition. When you do this, eventually others will come in to support you! You are a natural born leader and manager. Because you have the gift of empathy, people trust you, and you find fulfillment when you set up structures that support everyone’s well-being. Focusing on your vision for the future will help you let go of the past.
