You're expansive and open to inter-disciplinary fields. Drawn to sharing what you know with others, through teaching, counseling or as a spiritual quester and guide. You're the eternal student, and thrive in life work that allows you to research, investigate, explore, philosophize and connect dots. Some such fields are higher education, the clergy, journalism, languages, writing, photography, filmmaking and theatre. Travel unlocks new possibilities, as you weave in cross-cultural influences, ideas and wisdom.
