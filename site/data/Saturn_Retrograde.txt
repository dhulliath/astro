There can be more than usual experiences of guilt and self-doubt when Saturn is retrograde in the birth chart. Fears are internalized and they might put on a brave front so that others don’t see them as vulnerable. There can also be a strong fear of letting others down or of not filling their responsibilities – essentially of making poor choices. Sometimes the childhood was not very disciplined or orderly. In some ways, having Saturn retrograde in the chart tends to function much like a strong Uranus, where the native is uncomfortable with an overly orderly or disciplined life. People born with Saturn retrograde might feel especially anxious or nervous when they are in situations that call for protocol, etiquette, or specific sets of standards and rules.
