You need to bring about the fullest potential in the intense and secretive way in which you deal with, for instance, secret or hidden matters (the unconscious mind) etc. The answer lies in the missing part of something you have. It may be that, for instance, you seek to know others deeply, yet need to know yourself better. In any event, you may need to be more or less emotional, perhaps letting deep, secret negative memories be released emotionally (water).
