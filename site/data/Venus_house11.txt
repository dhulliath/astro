The friendship level of your relationship needs to be genuine in order for you to sustain romantic interest. You tend to focus on a person’s unique qualities — those traits that make him or her stand out — as the most attractive. Your relationships must possess some kind of unconventional element in order to keep your interest levels high. Calves and ankles are either erogenous zones for you, or parts of your body that are particularly attractive! You may meet lovers through group activities. Although you value friendships and group affiliations highly, you might jump into friendships without considering the responsibilities they might entail.
