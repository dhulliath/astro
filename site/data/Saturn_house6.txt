Saturn is most comfortable in the sixth house. This house rules your attitude to work, service, and your body. The sixth house is the house of self-denial in the sense that you put off pleasing yourself. It symbolizes activities that you pursue not to please yourself, as in the fifth house, but for another purpose. Working to make a living is a good example. This activity doesn’t necessarily please you but you do it anyways from a sense of responsibility. In that sense the sixth house is Saturnine. When Saturn happens to be in the sixth house of your natal chart you may very well be a workaholic. You may forget that you are working only to make a living. You may fall into the trap of living to work! Avoid doing this. In any case, you will have a strong sense of responsibility in your attitude to work and you will take service to others rather seriously. You may be overly concerned about what you feed yourself and spend time worrying about the food habits of your loved ones. All the sixth house functions are over-emphasized — a double whammy!
