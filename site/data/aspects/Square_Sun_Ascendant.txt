People born with Sun square Ascendant do not always “come across” to others as they intend to. Especially in their youth, these people can easily offend others with what people might call an “attitude”. Sometimes, the impression is one of being overbearing, arrogant, or pushy. If this is the case, it’s due to a defense mechanism perhaps stemming from childhood. For some reason or other, what these people want to express is often interpreted the wrong way. Awareness of this discrepancy is important, otherwise the defense mechanism can worsen over time, and natives of this aspect can meet with problems at work (especially with authority) and in personal relationships. Softening the manner and the attitude does wonders to smooth over relationships of all kinds.
