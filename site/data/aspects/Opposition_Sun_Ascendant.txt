There is a big tendency for those born under the Sun in opposition to the Ascendant to “find themselves” through other people. Most people with this aspect are in partnership with a close personal friend and/or a close romantic partner most of their lives with few gaps between. Just as Sun conjunct the Ascendant has an Aries flavor, the opposition has a Libra flavor, especially if the Sun is found in the seventh house. These people truly come alive when one-on-one. This makes them good at negotiations, therapy, and other situations where being able to slip into another’s shoes is advantageous. Decision-making is enjoyed best when shared with another person. These are people who are the first to call on a close personal friend or the spouse whenever a decision needs to be made–not that they always take that person’s advice! However, the back and forth of the exchange helps them to find an answer within. Again, this comes back to seeing themselves through others’ perspectives. These are not the types of people who go to movies or restaurants alone (by choice). They simply feel more powerful and happy with someone tagging along. Some are submissive, but most are not. They don’t truly give their power away to others. However, they don’t readily “own” their power without feedback from others, where the term “others” doesn’t refer to people in general, but to an individual. It’s not about reputation or saving face (although this is possible if the Sun is also square the Midheaven).
