The core meaning of the third house lies in the unconscious operating of the mind in familiar surroundings. The third house indicates the natural way you act and communicate with people. People might include your siblings while growing up, co-workers, neighbors, the grocery store clerk, and so on. You can review the way your mind works in these circumstances. In that sense, it’s not unconscious. The comedy serial, Seinfeld, explored the quirkiness in individual actions and communication in familiar surroundings — the little things that people do and say unconsciously that make them what they are! Yes, the serial about “nothing” was funny. Saturn in the third house may make you feel ill at ease while you go about day-to-day life. You may come across as cold and reserved. You may be a “man or woman of few words”. This can turn some people off. You can use this to your advantage by listening to people. That way you don’t have to do too much talking, yet people will love you for listening!
