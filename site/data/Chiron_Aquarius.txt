You need to bring about the fullest potential in the indifferent and unconventional way in which you deal with, for instance, friends, new ideas and discoveries, etc. The answer lies in the missing part of something you have. It may be that, for instance, you seek to be different but you need to pay attention to whether this is what you really want or whether it is a reaction to conventional thinking. Alternatively, you might need to be more indifferent to others and follow your own course, even if it is unconventional. Logic, communication, and information will be your main allies in resolving these issues (air).
