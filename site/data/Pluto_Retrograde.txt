People with Pluto retrograde in their birth charts may be more inclined to fear being controlled, manipulated, or betrayed by others than those with Pluto direct. There may be a tendency to keep these fears to themselves, as exposing them makes them feel more vulnerable. They donâ€™t as readily let others know their desire for power or control, and might not be in touch with this desire a lot of the time.
