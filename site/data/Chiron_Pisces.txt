You need to bring about the fullest potential in an impressionable and inspirational  way in which you deal with, for instance, religious beliefs or how you attain ecstasy, etc. The answer lies in the missing part of something you have. It may be that, for instance, you may be imaginative, psychic and caring, but you need to beware of deception, being too sensitive or caring too much. Alternatively, you might need to be more impressionable, etc. It is through your emotions, your sensitivity, your adaptability and your psychic ability that you will find the answers.,
