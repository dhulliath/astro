You aspire to cast a wide mental net, catch all the information you can, and shape it into new forms. This gives you gifts in fields like journalism, performance, teaching, writing, the Arts, design and fashion. Your gift of the gab helps you excel in sales, business, public relations, advertising, and being a 'spokesperson.' You enjoy work that puts you in the middle of chaos, change, excitement and a swift current of ideas.

You're a weaver of seemingly disparate threads, that are part of the whole. This makes you an asset to society, as a commentator, observer, translator and broadcaster. Your kind of fluid intelligence can be an eye-opener to more rigid minds. This gives you an important role, as a messenger of changes in thinking.
