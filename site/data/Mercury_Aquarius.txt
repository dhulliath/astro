You are particularly thoughtful, and your main concerns are with other people, mainly friends, but perhaps the world in general (air, public). Your thinking deals with the new and the unconventional. As a researcher or scientist you would happily take up unconventional ideas, and perhaps be happy to hold minority beliefs. Your communication can be somewhat aloof and indifferent, making you sound indifferent to personal matters. You could think upon mankind, but not be interested in people. You do not like change and tend to keep to your fixed unconventional beliefs, and you will also want to keep your friends. However, you are quite capable of making abrupt and sudden changes in your thinking. You seek the truth through communication and value the individual over authority.
