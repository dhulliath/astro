You are verbally expressive, diplomatic, and aim to be tactful. You easily win others over with your words, whether it’s because of a likeable facility with language, a beautiful voice, or a diplomatic use of words. You readily give out compliments. Some of you might use flattery to your own benefit at the risk of being ingenuine. You are generally a very good mediator, aiming to settle arguments quickly and restoring at least temporary peace. You have a mischievous side, however, and your desire to be tactful and polite with others doesn’t always succeed. Some of you might engage in a lot of mind games, and others might eventually find out that you don’t always mean what you say or say what you mean! You value mental stimulation and frequent changes of scenery in your love relationships.
