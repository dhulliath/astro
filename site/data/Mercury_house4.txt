You are an extremely imaginative person who dreams up all sorts of unusual ideas and plans. Your thinking is quite subjective, and in some cases narrow or biased. Some of you might enjoy working at home or keeping a lively, intellectual atmosphere in your home. You tend to retain a lot of information, and are usually quite interested in history, psychology, or politics. You are not quick to embrace a new idea or plan, and can be quite traditional in your thinking.
