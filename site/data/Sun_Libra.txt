You are diplomatic and tend to avoid offending others (diplomatic), and seek harmony. You are good at relating to others (harmony), and tend to be self motivated (active) but take into consideration what others will think (harmony).<br/>
<br/>
It may be more important to 'keep the peace' than to seek the truth. Venus, who rules Libra, is also the goddess of victory, which in this case means the peace after the struggle (Venus is not adept at war, and is never directly harmful). You are a thinker (air), and so you are not emotionally driven.<br/>
<br/>
Your basic nature does not sit too well with some of your relationships (sun in fall): the self (sun) is in the sign of the other person. But your diplomacy carries you through. You are fair in your dealings with others (I balance). You start new things, such as new relationships very easily (enterprising).<br/>
<br/>
The archetype is the beautiful goddess who charms everyone and teaches the diplomatic way to get what you want.
