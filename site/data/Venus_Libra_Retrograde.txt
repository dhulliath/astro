Venus in Libra and retrograde, the love nature is very refined. There can be some challenges, particularly for women, truly believing in their attractiveness. While they may not judge others based on looks alone, they tend to feel self-conscious about their own physical appearance. In love, there can be a great need for closeness and companionship, but some shying away from true intimacy. They can be very idealistic about love and their feelings can be hurt easily. There can be a lot of indecision when it comes to entering and exiting love relationships, and some over-analysis of their partnerships.
