Each planet in the twelfth house represents energies that an individual may be denying even exists. Saturn in this house could mean an early life setback which prompts you to push the realities of life into the unconscious. People with this position of Saturn often are plagued with guilt and it is difficult for them to know where the guilt is coming from, or even to define their anxieties. Fear of the unknown and of being overwhelmed or controlled by emotions may be the source of your general anxiety in life. It can be difficult for you to submit to the idea that you may need help from others, preferring instead to withdraw and handle your problems in solitude. The idea of exposing your innermost feelings makes you feel painfully vulnerable and dependent on others. A deep-seated feeling of loneliness and separateness can be the result. While self-control seems to be the most attractive route for you, you might find that letting others inside you, even in little ways, will help you overcome many of the vague feelings of guilt, self-doubt, and anxiety that prevent you from enjoying life in a free and natural manner. Learning to embrace your sorrow, free from guilt, is the first step towards true self-acceptance. You may be an escapist from life itself. Address your escapism. Question yourself, or talk things through with an alter ego. Make sure that you understand the demands of the real world, as well as its joys and pleasures. This will help you lead a more fulfilling and rich life.
