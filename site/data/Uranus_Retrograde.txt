Uranus retrograde can point to a fear of change or a latent mistrust of new technologies or improvements. These people might hide their eccentricities, while Uranus direct natives are more inclined to flaunt them, or at least to be proud of them.

There can be pent up energy with this position, so that while they may be following rules for some time, at a certain point they bust out with a fit of rebellion before going back to a more orderly, law-abiding lifestyle.
