You wish to create a good impression, and are concerned about what others think (impressive). You are naturally creative and innovative. You are regally forceful in the way you approach your life (fire). You also have a tendency to act first and think later (fire), but you can resist this (fixed) and avoid acting purely on the spur of the moment. You are active and tend to do things because you want to do them, and you tend to be direct in the way you solve problems and deal with others (active), but this is mediated by your way of not wishing "to rock the boat" (fixed).<br/>
<br/>
What is important to you is, well, being important. You have to be the centre of things.<br/>
<br/>
The archetype is the king, the ruler. Or the actor, or even the clown. Just as the sun is the centre of our galaxy, so what is important to you is being the centre of things, with everything revolving around you.
