While the sixth house rules work, the tenth house rules the work that you identify with. In the context of home and family, the tenth house signifies your attitude while playing the “fathering” role. Saturn in the tenth house makes you take your “fathering” responsibilities seriously. You will be concerned with the development and growth of your child in real world terms. At work, you may have the desire to lead or guide co-workers. In any case, you will take your career or chosen profession more seriously than most. Both at work and home, your teaching or leadership style will be based on practical aspects of life. You are acutely aware (more so than most) of your place and “role” in society. You may feel like you are under a magnifying glass, so to speak, when it comes to the path you choose to take in your career or in the roles you take on. Defensiveness and self-consciousness about your importance in the material world can result. A rather conservative approach to life is often adopted, which may or may not conflict with your more personal aspirations. You will shoulder immense responsibilities with ease. This might not always work for you. Take care not to take on too much at a time. If you feel overloaded with responsibilities – delegate some!
