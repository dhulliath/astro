People born with Jupiter retrograde in their natal charts tend to have different or unusual perspectives, belief systems, or sets of morals. They prefer to learn from their own experiences and reactions to them, rather than from others. Because they donâ€™t intrinsically have faith in being lucky, they are planners who worry about their future or consequences of their actions more than others. They may need to learn that they deserve what others might naturally feel entitled to.
