The South Node in Virgo suggests an innate practicality and sense of order, but also a sense of panic an anxiety when things do not go as planned. Therefore, you may burden yourself and others with rigid expectations of proper behavior or “perfect” situations. The North Node in Pisces represents this lifetime’s mission: let go of worry and work on developing a sense of the connectedness of everyone and everything. Your longing for order and perfection is satisfied only through the realization that everything is in divine order, even if our limited human minds perceive only chaos.
