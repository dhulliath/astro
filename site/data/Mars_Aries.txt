When Mars in Aries people listen to their instincts, they generally get things done, and they make fast and (usually) decent decisions. They don’t naturally stop to smell the roses–or consider others’ point of view–when they are deliberating over what to do next. In fact, “deliberation” works at lightning speed for these natives, so they could hardly be called deliberate. Spontaneity is one of their assets; as are simplicity, purity of action, and innovation.

Mars in Aries natives are often a step ahead of the rest of us. A life that is too predictable makes them antsy. Mars in Aries people enjoy starting freshnew ideas, pioneering action, and fresh projects make them happiest. They generally enjoy challenges. Relationships with these natives can be exciting, but keeping up with them can be difficult. They are given to impulsive action, and they are not known for sticking things through. Although their physical energy is great, they can lose their initial enthusiasm quickly.

Mars in Aries natives are easily irritated by indirectness from others. They expect others to say things straightno beating around the bush. They easily become impatient with convoluted plans, or with people they consider to be slow to action. Most people with this position of Mars have a childlike quality to them. Sometimes they’re downright rude and impatient, but with Mars in Aries natives, you generally know what they’re after. Unless Mars is afflicted in the chart, you can also pretty much trust that they don’t have hidden agendas.
