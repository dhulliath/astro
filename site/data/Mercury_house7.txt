You have a great love of debate, if only to get closer to your own thoughts and opinions. Bouncing ideas off others helps you to make a decision, although coming to definite conclusions can be painfully difficult for you. You see the other side of the coin. You might often play devil’s advocate. Communication with a partner is craved, and you also love an audience for your own thoughts and opinions, but preferably a one-person audience, as you come alive verbally when it’s one-on-one. You can be quite skilled at keeping a partnership animated and alive with interesting tidbits, new ideas, and stimulating conversation. You can easily become bored in partnership if the lines of communication go down, even temporarily. You might attract partners who are not especially sincere or downright duplicitous. In order to put an end to this pattern, you might try to avoid scheming and overanalyzing in your relationships. You might also love to talk about and analyze relationships and marriage. You get off on new perspectives that partners or good friends give you.
