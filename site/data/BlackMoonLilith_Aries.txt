In Aries, Lilith embodies the spirit of competition. She’s politically active, channeling her rage into action that supports independence of spirit and letting her voice be heard around the world. Lilith in Aries desires complete domination over her haters, no matter what the arena (case in point, Lebron James). If her fierce temper doesn’t have a suitable outlet, it can disrupt the lives of those around her.
