With Venus in Leo and retrograde, the need for reassurance common to many people born with Venus retrograde is pronounced. There can be a tendency to be devout and loyal to the wrong people, or to stick with a bad relationship for too long. When insecure, they may show affection through generous gifts, which can be misunderstood. Retrograde Venus in Leo may not be as confident in love as the rest of the Venus in Leo group, although they may not let others know this, nevertheless acting with pride and hiding their wounds from love, or covering up their fear of rejection with a veneer of confidence.
