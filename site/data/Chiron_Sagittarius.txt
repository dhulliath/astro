You need to bring about the fullest potential in the free and tolerant way in which you deal with, for instance, philosophy, your high standards, long journeys etc. The answer lies in the missing part of something you have. It may be that, for instance, you seek to know but you need to listen and learn. Or you could be too tolerant in your beliefs, or even too intolerant! Through the areas of optimism, action and enthusiasm, you may find your resolution.
