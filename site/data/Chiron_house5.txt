May indicate a feeling of having to take life too seriously, too early. You are easily deflated due, probably, to parents who told you that you could not do ‘that’ – though you would have known that you could. There will be a need to draw boundaries for ego survival. Though do not go so far as to cut yourself off from people completely. You are very creative but do not recognize it. Just do it.
