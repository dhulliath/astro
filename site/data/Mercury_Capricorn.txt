A practical, cautious careful thinker and communicator. You are careful about what you say (prudent). You think about things which are practical and useful (earth). You start new enterprises, but only after careful thought, and you will become involved in things only if they are proved and tangible. If you are a researcher, you will work carefully and meticulously, but you will tend to follow the tried and true, rather than to deal with completely different ideas.
