These are not your typical warrior, risk-taking Venus in Aries people. With Venus retrograde in Aries, there is a shyness present that is certainly attractive, but that is not necessarily as open and free-wheeling as the rest of the Venus in Aries group. There can be a very strong defense mechanism in love â€“ these people will not like others knowing they fear rejection, and will not like to talk about, or admit, having been rejected in love.
